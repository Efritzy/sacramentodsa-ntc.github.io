He warns that if we don't broaden our coalitions and solidarity while deepening our commitment to fight austerity, racism and xenophobia, anti-labor policy, and reproductive rights—just to name a few—then we will lose to the fascistic movements afoot in Washington.

Fred Glass is the former Communications Director for the California Federation of Teachers and author of the new book [From Mission to Microchip: A History of the California Labor Movement (University of California Press, 2016)](https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520288416). He is the producer for the ten-part documentary video series on the history of the California labor movement, [Golden Lands, Working Hands (1999)](http://cft.org/member-services/labor-education/golden-lands,-working-hands.html), aired on most PBS stations in California. He is also instructor of Labor and Community Studies at City College of San Francisco.

Fred's book "From Mission to Microchip: A History of the California Labor Movement" is the first overview of California's labor history since 1960. It is [available from UC Press](https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520288416) or from your local independent bookstore.
