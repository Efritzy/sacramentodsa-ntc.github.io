title: "Chapter Statement on COVID Crisis"
author: The COVID-19 Crisis has impacted the most vulnerable among us the hardest: working people, undocumented, the unhoused, and the uninsured. People of color, and especially black people, are dying at disproportionate rates. More than a public health crisis, the pandemic is quickly becoming an economic catastrophe with 2.7 million filing for unemployment in California since the crisis began. Every day more people’s homes, health, and livelihoods are thrown into jeopardy.

As socialists, we know that the divisions of privilege made deeper and more visible by the pandemic are not new. They are inherent in our politics under capitalism. This crisis has made it evident that only through solidarity can we secure everyone’s safety and a just, equitable future.

The Sacramento chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America demands that Mayor Steinberg, The County Board of Supervisors, and Governor Newsom take immediate action on the following for the duration of the COVID-19 Crisis:

The Democratic Socialists of America Sacramento also understands that it is not enough only to call on our elected officials. We must also join in solidarity with those in our community who are organizing and providing mutual aid. We would like to demonstrate explicit support for these causes, and hope that as many of our members as possible can join them. We stand in solidarity with and echo the demands of the following organizations that have stepped up in the face of this pandemic. We encourage people to reach out to the following organizations which are providing material and educational resources for the public:

We encourage members to donate time or materials as they are able to these worthy projects. Further, we hope that more people will join us as DSA members, to add their bodies and contribute materials to these causes and the overall cause of organizing the working class.

In addition to supporting the organizations listed above, we also encourage people to take the following steps:

Our health, safety, and dignity is not something we will allow capitalists and landlords to control any longer. **The time to stand together is now.** There is power in numbers, there is security in solidarity.
