Sacramento, CA — The Sacramento Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) won a seat on the city council in a hotly contested race, with results still trickling in from the March 3rd election. Sacramento DSA’s endorsed candidate and member, Katie Valenzuela, unseated the incumbent, becoming the first democratic socialist city council member elected in Sacramento.

  


Katie Valenzuela, a staunch advocate for renters and supporter of the ballot measure for real rent control (Sacramento Renter Protection and Community Stabilization Charter Amendment), made tenant protections, rent control, and homelessness major planks of her campaign in a district where rents are some of the fastest rising in the nation.

  


“Voters are tired of a city government that does shady backroom deals for the benefit of developers and business interests over those of renters trying to get by,” said Cori Ring-Martinez, one of Sacramento DSA’s two cohairs.

  


The race for City Council District 4  pitted the interests of working-class Sacramentans and renters, represented by Valenzuela, a midtown renter herself, against those of the real estate and development lobbyists, who donated thousands of dollars to the incumbent, Steve Hansen. Valenzuela’s grassroots campaign drew support from the local community who, along with DSA members, knocked on thousands of doors over the course of her campaign. In addition to rent control and affordable housing, Katie also supports Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, public ownership of utilities, the right of all workers to unionize, the Movement for Black Lives, and College for All.

  


“Katie Valenzuela’s win means that the working-class of Sacramento has a true ally in City Hall,” said Ring-Martinez. “Katie will help DSA and our community allies make real rent control and a Green New Deal a reality for Sacramento.”

  


Katie Valenzuela’s victory, along with Bernie Sanders’ decisive win in the Sacramento Region, has truly demonstrated the power of working-class Sacramentans and the growing movement for democratic socialism.
