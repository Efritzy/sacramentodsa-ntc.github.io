At our last General Membership Meeting, the membership authorized the creation of the very first chapter podcast! Socialized Sacramento is co-hosted by Skyler Henry and Cori Ring-Martinez, and produced by Skyler Henry.

In the inaugural episode of Socialized Sacramento: The Sac DSA Podcast, the hosts discuss the last general membership meeting, recap local events, and speak to Peter Lucas about the teacher's strike in Sacramento.

You can listen to the [first episode here](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-fcwz3-b118a7) !

Be on the lookout for future episodes!
