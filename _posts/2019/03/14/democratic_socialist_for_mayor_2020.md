title: "We Need a Democratic Socialist Mayor in 2020 - Democratic Socialists of America, Sacramento"
author: In 2020, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg will be up for re-election. Steinberg's tenure as mayor has been one marked by anti-blackness, a disregard for the public, and neoliberal economics that continue to deepen our housing crisis. Steinberg was elected on a platform of helping the unhoused - but has since supported bans on street camping and panhandling. He has dismissed the picket lines of organized labor as “street theatrics.” He has constantly violated the Brown Act and has publicly disregarded the perspectives of black people who come to city council chambers demanding justice for black lives, even going so far as to cut them off in the middle of their public comments. Steinberg has also praised the private healthcare giant Centene and spoken favorably about the privatization of healthcare work at UC Davis. He has also come out against the rent control campaign in favor of neoliberal “means tested” measures, completely disregarding the economic reality that is Sacramento’s rent crisis.

Steinberg needs to go, but who can replace him? Who should run for Mayor of Sacramento in 2020? A democratic socialist, that's who.

There are a number of reasons why this would be good for our community. It coincides perfectly with DSA’s national electoral platform, which has been yielding successful results. DSA members and endorsed candidates such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Lee Carter, plus several city council and school board members across the country can attribute their successes to the current DSA electoral strategy. Getting socialists elected to as many levels of public office as possible is a must in order to see socialist politics enter the mainstream. The exponential growth of DSA also makes this the right time to run as many socialists as possible. As the lyrics of the Internationale states, we must "strike while the iron is hot." We also need as many members of the working class as possible to infiltrate the public sphere. Policies that put community and humanity ahead of neoliberal profits will only come to fruition if members of the community become the ones making policy decisions.



We must not run someone for the sake of running. A key priority of our electoral strategy is that we are not about protest candidates, we run and endorse people to win and to win for socialism. With that in mind, we must also run someone who DSA as an organization is capable of holding to public scrutiny to be sure they are in accordance with what we stand for, including matters of national and international importance, not just local policies.



If DSA puts forward a candidate for Mayor in 2020, then that candidate must:

Support rent control.

End attacks on the unhoused and expand all public services, such as public restrooms, while repealing the camping ordinance

Support Medicare For All

Stand for black and brown lives and demand the immediate firing of any police officer responsible for shooting an unarmed person of color.

Declare support for the boycott divest and sanction movement and encourage the city council to do so as well.

Support Green Jobs programs to combat the effects of climate change
