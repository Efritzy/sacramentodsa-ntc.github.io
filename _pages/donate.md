We need your financial support to keep building a socialist movement in the Capital City. Whether it's strike support, canvassing, membership meetings, or educational events, your contributions make our organizing possible.

*Sacramento DSA relies on donations to do its work, but donating isn't the same as joining. To join the Democratic Socialists of America, please sign up at <https://dsausa.org/join>*
