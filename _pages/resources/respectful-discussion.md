*Please respect these guidelines at all Sac DSA Events.*

**Assume good faith in your fellow comrades**

Assume good faith in each other. Please try to speak from experience, speak for yourself, and actively listen to each other. Encourage yourself and others to maintain a positive attitude, honor the work of others, avoid defensiveness, be open to legitimate critique and challenge oppressive behaviors in ways that help people grow. 

**Know whether you need to “step up” or “step back”**

Help create a safe and inclusive space for everybody. Please respect others by recognizing how often, much, and loud you’re speaking and whether or not you’re dominating conversation. Step back to leave space for others to voice their opinions and feelings. On the other hand, if you don’t often speak up, we encourage you to do so now!

**Please ask yourself “Why am I Talking?”**

We have a limited amount of time for discussion and to accomplish the tasks before us. When in discussion, consider whether or not what you want to say has already been said, whether what you want to say is on topic or if there’s a better time and place to say it, and other methods for showing how you feel about the conversation (nodding your head, etc.)

**Please recognize and respect others feelings, background, and cultural differences**

Many people have different levels of experience, knowledge, and feelings in social justice and radical activism and all participants should respect and embrace this diversity. While we all don’t have to agree on everything, we should respect our diversity of opinions. Recognize that everyone has a piece of the truth, everybody can learn, and everybody has the ability to teach and share something.

**We have “one mic” so do not interrupt or speak while others are talking**

Many of us will have different opinions on matters. However, speaking while others are talking or adding comments when they cannot respond appropriately does not build community. If you have a disagreement, wait for your turn to address it. This is basic politeness.

**Respect the facilitator when they use Progressive Stack**

Progressive Stack is a form of leading discussions which involves a facilitator keeping a list of names of people who wish to speak. However, the facilitator does not simply write a list of names in the order that people raise their hand. Rather, if someone who has not spoken raises their hand, they go to the top of the list. If someone who is of an oppressed group raises their hand, they go to the top of the list unless they have already contributed significantly to the discussion.

**Have a sense of humor**

Who said movement building can’t be fun? This is a great opportunity for people to get to know one another, building lasting friendships and relationships, to laugh, love, and build a movement.

And, as always, please inform organizers of inappropriate behavior immediately by emailing our chapter’s Harassment & Grievance officers at hgo@sacdsa.org.
