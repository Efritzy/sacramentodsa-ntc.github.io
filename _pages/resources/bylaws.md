## Name.

The name of the Local shall be the Sacramento Local of the Democratic Socialists of America, also known colloquially as DSA Sacramento or Sacramento DSA.

## Purpose.

The Sacramento Local of the Democratic Socialists of America seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and socially controlled.

DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race and sex, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations -- recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic left. In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society. This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.

All members in leadership roles, including but not limited to e-board and co-chair positions, are required to undergo anti-oppression training that addresses anti-racism, socialist feminism, disability justice, and other topics critical to our collective liberation. These trainings must occur within the first three months of leadership, and failure to complete these trainings will result in leadership benefits, such as voting rights, being revoked.

An ad hoc working group will be formed to further determine the content of this training and will present an overview of the final content, materials, and potential facilitators of these training sessions to the general body before being adopted and shall be reviewed every 2 years.

This requirement retroactively applies to current leadership, who should fulfill the requirement within 3 months of the completion of training materials. 

The requirement applies to each new board, including recurring board members who may have completed past training.

#### Executive Board.

The Executive Board consists of two Co-Chairs, one Secretary-Treasurer, one Membership Coordinator, and three Organizers. After September 2017 Elections the board will consist of two Co-chairs, one Secretary, one Treasurer, and three Organizers.

The Executive Board must hold one in-person business meeting per month. Business meetings must be publicized to the General Membership, and be open for attendance by the General Membership. Notes from each Executive Board business meeting must be made available to the General Membership following the meeting.

If any officer misses two Executive Board business meetings in a row, a referendum will be called. If the Executive Board does not hold a meeting, it counts as one absence for the entire Executive Board.

The Executive Board reviews all committee expenditures and campaigns, and agendizes such motions for ratification at the General Membership Meeting. The Executive Board reviews urgent committee actions that cannot be brought before the General Membership, and approves of such motions by consent. The Executive Board has 24 hours to object to urgent committee motions. If no objection is made, the committee motion passes.

The Executive Board determines the allocation of resources to all committees.

The Executive Board may also recommend the dismantling of any committee to the General Membership.

If any member of the Executive Board resigns from their post, the remaining Executive Board members will select an Interim Officer to assume the role until elections can be held.

The Executive Board is responsible for considering and responding to all chapter requirements and action requests as dictated by the DSA National Organization, being responsive to such requirements/requests, and communicating these requirements/request to the General Membership.

The Executive Board motions need to pass by majority of the board membership.

## Committees.

DSA Sacramento will defer to Robert’s Rules of Order to distinguish between committees and standing committees.

####  Formation of Committees

Ideas for committees must be proposed in front of the General Membership. At that time, three dues-paying members in total must come forward, stating their willingness to participate in the committee. An Organizer must also come forward, stating their willingness to sponsor and assume responsibility for the committee. If and when these requirements are met, the group is assigned “working group” status. The group then is tasked with the following, to be completed by the next general membership meeting:

  - Hold a meeting and elect a committee chair (committee chairs may not be Officers)
  - Prepare a presentation to be given in front of the general membership, outlining the purpose and intent of the committee

Following the presentation, the General Membership will vote to ratify the proposed committee. A committee needs to acquire a simple majority vote in favor in order to proceed.

#### Committee Operations

Committee leadership must notify their assigned Organizer of all committee business. Committee leadership must invite their assigned Organizer to all committee meetings and events.

Committees must bring all committee expenditures and campaigns before the Executive Board, so such actions may be agendized for the General Membership Meeting.

Committees must seek the approval of the General Membership for all campaigns.

Committees must report all actions and campaigns to the Media Committee for publicity.

In the event that a committee faces a time-sensitive motion that cannot be brought before the General Membership before action is required, that committee may bring the motion before the Executive Board for approval by consent.

Committees may be dismantled by a vote of the General Membership, brought about by: recommendation of the Executive Board; or recommendation by any General Member, for reasons such as violating DSA Sacramento bylaws. Committees may also self-dismantle at any time.

Committees are expected to help manage press inquiries regarding committee business.

## Working Groups.

At that time, two dues-paying members in total must come forward, stating their willingness to participate in the working group. The purpose of the working group, as well as the expected end-date of the project, must also be stated.

Following the proposal, the General Membership will vote whether or not to give permission to proceed with the working group. A working group needs to acquire a simple majority vote in favor in order to proceed.

Working groups must report to the Executive Committee. All working group actions must be brought before the Executive Board for consent.

Working groups must report all actions and campaigns to the Media Committee for publicity.

Working groups may seek a deadline extension by vote of the General Membership.

## Membership.

Members of the Sacramento DSA are those individuals whose dues to national DSA are paid in full. It will be the responsibility of members to approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the local chapter, to elect delegates to the national convention, to vote on matters related to national policy, and to make recommendations on issues and other matters to the National Political Committee of DSA. 

Individuals whose dues to national DSA are unpaid may still participate as non-voting volunteers. These non-voting volunteers may not hold office, may not chair committees or working groups, and may not count toward quorum.

If a member is found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of national DSA, or if that member is found to be consistently engaging in undemocratic, disruptive behavior, or if that member is found to be under the discipline of any self-defined democratic centralist organization, the Local may vote to expel her/him from DSA. In order for such a finding to be made, another DSA member must formally prefer written charges against the member in question to the Local Executive Committee, which shall set the date of a Local meeting for deliberations on the charges. The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of two weeks before that meeting takes place. Expulsion of a member or affiliate member requires a two-thirds vote of the Local meeting. An expelled member may appeal to the National Political Committee of DSA.

## Voting and Election Procedures.

Voting in all elections will be conducted by secret ballot, also known as the Australian ballot, either on paper or digitally.
