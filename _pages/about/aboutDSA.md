# About DSA
## Learn about our organization

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization
in the United States. DSA's members are building progressive movements for
social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in
American communities and politics.

At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and
end. Because we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA
fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase
the power of working people. For example, we support reforms that

* Decrease the influence of money in politics
* Empower ordinary people in workplaces and the economy
* Redistribute wealth and decommodify basic needs
* Restructure gender and cultural relationships to be more equitable

We are committed to democracy as not simply one of our political values but our
means of restructuring society. Our vision is of a society in which people have
a real voice in the choices and relationships that affect the entirety of our
lives. We call this vision democratic socialism â€” a vision of a more free,
democratic, and humane society.
