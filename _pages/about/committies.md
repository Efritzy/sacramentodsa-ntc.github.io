Sacramento DSA is the chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America that covers the Sacramento region. Whether we're [rallying against ICE](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article214129234.html), hosting socialist reading groups, [qualifying rent control control on the March 2020 Sacramento ballot](https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article219885625.html), or [demanding public ownership of our power grid](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/01/31/utility-california-fire-public/) we have dozens of projects that you can take part in today!
